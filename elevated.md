# Elevated

*Female:* "Hello, and welcome, to a special edition of Looking Back. We're joined today by Jim Huck&#x2013;last surviving member of the elevated&#x2013;who was there the day the Sheen came, fifty years ago today. Welcome to the programme, Jim, we're grateful for you being here. You've travelled all the way from Carmarthen in Wales, is that right?"

*Male:* "That's right, Sarah, that's right. Not an easy journey these days, I'll tell you that for free, but here I am."

*Female:* "Well, we do appreciate it, Jim, we really do. We've invited you here today to talk about life before&#x2013;and after&#x2013;the Sheen came, and the tether was destroyed. It was 50 years ago today, Jim; how does it feel looking back on such a historic moment?"

*Male:* "Well, Sarah, 50 years is a long time, isn't it?. A person can be born, grow old, and die in that time. I bet it's all ancient history to you, isn't it?"

*Female:* "I wasn't around back then, for sure, but my parents were. I guess you could say I grew up with it; with the memories my parents had. What about you, Jim? What do you remember?"

*Male:* "Let me tell you something, Sarah. Since the Sheen came, I've married, raised a family, and said goodbye to it all. My wife died eleven years ago, and Karen&#x2013;our eldest&#x2013;left in the diaspora. By all rights I shouldn't feel a thing about something that happened half a century ago. But, I must say I remember those days like they were yesterday. I remember the elevator; the way it looked from the sea; the way the tether rose up from the ice and mountains, and faded into the clouds or disappeared into the heavens on a clear day. I remember the first time I saw it, face-to-face so to speak. Brought a tear to my eye, it did. I'd worked hard to see it, been training for years in school, and then the academy. To be there, for real&#x2013;never mind the wind and the snow&#x2013;it was like a dream come true. Just to see it. Just to be close to it."

*Female:* "What did it mean to you, Jim? The elevator?"

*Male:* "Well, what did it mean to all of us? It was hope, wasn't it? It was the future of mankind, manifest in steel and sky. Start of a new chapter it was. It didn't just lift goods, in my book. It lifted all of us, elevated the lot of us; closer to the stars, closer to our destiny."

*Female:* "And it ended up being your destiny too, didn't it Jim? Did you ever think you'd be going up? Back then, I mean, when you first saw it?"

*Male:* "Not for a minute, Sarah. Not even for a minute. I mean, I'd dreamt of it, you know. We all had. Ever since I'd been a boy I'd wanted to be up there; piloting the ships to Mars, or building the cities on the Moon. That was our reason to exist in those days, so of course I wanted to be up there. But they didn't let just anyone up the elevator. You had to be the best and the brightest, perfect in every way. Well, the day I got these glasses I knew: I'd never do more than dream of riding it up to the top."

*Female:* "So tell us about it, Jim. How did your dream come true?"

*Male:* "Pure luck, I'd say. A happy coincidence, and one for which I'm eternally grateful. I'd enlisted in the Alliance Navy, see, that's how I got to see it up-close in the first place. The only way to go there, if you weren't riding it to the top, was to work on the supply runs, and they were all operated by the Navy. Back then, everything was about the elevator. If you weren't growing something to go up, you were making something to go up. If you enlisted, sooner or later you were shipping something to go up, so there I was. Now, you've seen pictures of it, I suppose?"

*Female:* "Yes, of course&#x2013;"

*Male:* "Well, it's nothing like them. You can't capture that kind of perspective in a picture, it's just not possible. You've got to start with a tree. Imagine a tree; thin-like, with a tangle of roots all gnarled and knotted around some rocks. Those roots weave and twist into a trunk incredibly thin, and impossibly tall. It shoots up into the atmosphere, like a needle joining the sky to the ground. That's what it was like, except those roots were a metre thick, and there were thousands of them. Tens of thousands. And the rocks they were clinging to were the high mountains of the Antarctic, frigid, barren, and uncompromising. The roots of the Earth, holding down the roots of the sky. It was like an old yew, clinging to the summit of some windswept crag, but a hundred times bigger and a thousand times more unlikely.

"And it was so tall, Sarah! On a clear day, you could look up, and up, and up, until the tether punctured the clouds or faded to nothing in the haze. If the elevator was coming down, it would unfurl through the banks of clouds like a floating leviathan, or glint in the heavens like a jewel suspended in the stratosphere.

"If it hadn't all been so delicate and fragile-looking, you'd have said it held up the sky, like the shoulders of Atlas. But it was too thin for that, more like a strand of thread spun out into space, threatening to snap and unravel at any moment, except it never did.

*Female:* "Until the Sheen came."

*Male:* "Yes, until the Sheen came. But, I try not to think about that."

*Female:* "Why's that, Jim?"

*Male:* "Well, Sarah, there was life before the Sheen, and there was life after too. People still lived, and died; fell in love, and got their hearts broken. We still had hopes, and dreams; things we were proud of, and things we were ashamed off. Before the Sheen came, everything was about the elevator. We were like a furious swarm of ants, rushing around to grow things, make things, ship things and lift things. All to get things out to space, out to the frontier. We never had a second thought for life down here, for what life was worth on solid ground.

"The Sheen changed all that. And yes, it was traumatic. And yes, a lot of people had a lot to lose when it came, but we had a lot to gain too.

"Wouldn't have met my wife without it. Wouldn't have had my girls. I had a hard time seeing it at the time, but there's more to life than getting on and getting up. More to life than reaching for the stars and exploring the unknown.

"I see that now, and I think a lot of other people do too. So, you see, I don't think much about what happened any more. I think about what came next. What we lost isn't as important as what we gained."

*Female:* "I hear you, Jim, but there's a lot of people out there who feel differently about it. You know that first-hand, I'm sure. What would you say to those people, given you were there when it all happened?"

*Male:* "I know it all too well, Sarah, all too well. My little girl left in the second wave of the diaspora. Only nineteen she was, barely into adulthood, but she was so adamant about it. So fired up with a desire to get out there, to be among the stars. How could I argue when I knew that feeling so well? I couldn't blame her for wanting something I'd wanted all my life.

"But, still. Devastating, it was. To lose so many of our young ones, to a desperate flight to the stars. They'd have been better off down here, I can tell you.

"You see, from down here, you look up and you see a thousand points of light set in an ocean of darkness. It's thrilling, enthralling, alluring. I know that.

"But from up there&#x2013;from the elevator&#x2013;those points of lights wink out amid the glory of the Earth's light. Our planet is the most magnificent, incomprehensible, vast tapestry of colour you could imagine. The night sky doesn't look so grand when you're up there, looking down.

"I've seen both points of view, Sarah, and I can honestly say that, given the choice, I'd rather be down here than up there. We were born here, Sarah. We're meant to live here. To die here.

"The Sheens came, and there's not a thing we can do about it. We spent so many years trying to get up there, out there, to drive them back. But, they came anyway and cut the tether like it was nothing. We've got to learn to live with them, and say goodbye to the world without them. That world's never coming back. Just like our children aren't coming back. We've got to say goodbye, and move on with our lives. Down here, where we belong."

*Female:* "Tell us more about the day you went up, Jim. How did it all happen?"

*Male:* "Well, let's see. It was my fourth or fifth year at sea, and the weather was bad; not storms and gales bad, but bitter-cold bad. The ship was surrounded by a freezing mist out of which icebergs would loom like spectres, and on the rare occasion the mist cleared all it revealed were banks of low hanging clouds almost low enough to skim the radio masts.

"I remember I was on-deck when we arrived. The air had cleared a little, but there was still a lot of low-hanging cloud. There was a bank of cloud covering the base station, and another just above the top so that the tether rose from the summit and disappeared into the haze. Without a top or a bottom, it almost looked like the mountain top was hanging from the tether like a pendulum, suspended from the clouds.

"My place was in the engine room, so when we were in-dock there wasn't much for us engineers to do. We used to take it in turns to take shore leave on the mountain. I used to love it, I did. That mountain was the closest you could get to space without setting foot on the elevator, the foot of the ladder so-to-speak. I'd spend hours wandering around the station, trying to imagine I was one of them.

"There were bars selling over-priced drinks, cafés selling over-priced food, machine-shops like you've never seen, and&#x2013;every now and then&#x2013;a courtyard with a bundle of carbon nano-tube fibres burying themselves into the rock. Those were my favourite spots. You had to wrap yourself up in all your winter layers, so not many people did it, but I used to just sit out there with my back against the fibres. You couldn't tell by looking at them, but if you relaxed and sat there long enough you could feel them up and down your spine. It was half way between a high-pitched vibration, and a gentle swaying motion; always on the edge of perception. If you focussed too hard on it, it would disappear, but when you caught it just right you were connected. All the way from your spine up and up, all the way to the top station. I remember that like it was yesterday.

"That's where I was when they made the announcement. The elevator had just launched and they'd reported a problem eight or nine kilometres up. Something to do with the mag-locks. Wanted to know if there were any engineers on-site with experience who could be flown up at short notice to assess the trouble."

*Female:* "And what did you do, Jim?"

*Male:* "Well, I reported in, didn't I? Funny really, these specks had always been a problem for those fellas. All my life they'd stopped me before I'd begun. But, that day, no-one even gave them a second glance. Before I knew it, I was on a jet-drone rising away from the mountain and into the blanket of clouds above.

"It was all snow and blizzard in those clouds, and my little drone was buffeted all over the place. I tell you, Sarah, at some points I was a little worried I might not make it in that little tin can! But, soon enough we shot through the clouds into brilliant blue sky beyond. The tether was there, clear as day; rising out of the clouds straight as an arrow. A couple of kilometres further up, I could just make out the glint of the elevator perched on top like a spinning plate.

"But that was all as nothing, to the view further on, and further up. It was like the Moon on a cold Winter's day, hidden in plain sight amongst the azure. It wasn't the Moon, though, it was the top station. The size of a thumbnail it was, barely visible, but remarkable enough to catch the eye. A tiny, spoked wheel, hanging translucently on the edge of the world.

"Never thought I'd see it, you know. Not even at that distance. You can't see it from the ground, so unless you go up in the elevator, or fly a high-altitude plane, you'll never even catch a glimpse of it. But there it was, and I was getting closer every moment."

*Female:* "What happened next, Jim?"

*Male:* "Oh, well, the rest is history, isn't is Sarah?"

*Female:* "Tell us anyway."

*Male:* "Well, I reached the elevator, didn't I?  Climbed aboard, walked amongst the crew in their smart uniforms, and their perfect eyesight&#x2013;ha! Then I got to work. They showed me to the problem, gave me some tools, and I fixed it. Simple really. Then we carried on going.

"They were in a rush, see. Everyone was in such a rush in those days. They didn't want to have to go down again, and didn't want me to disembark in case it broke again further up. They got me comfortable in the observation lounge, and left me by myself.

"I have a memory of that room that's so clear, it's like a single moment frozen in time. It was small, dark, with a long sofa and a panoramic window that stretched overhead. From the seat, you could look right up, and into space. The door panel, and the light switch were both illuminated, reflecting in the dark glass, reminding you of the invisible barrier between you and the void beyond. The sky went from white-blue, to midnight-blue, to star-speckled darkness. The whole world spread out before me and upwards&#x2026;the top station rotating slowly, the tether wending out to meet it, and beyond that: nothing. Space, Sarah. I was in space."

*Female:* "And you stayed up there, didn't you?"

*Male:* "Hmm? Yes, yes, that's right. Well, they only sent the elevator up and down when they needed to. Enormous amounts of energy required to lift it up, you know. Said they always needed good engineers, gave me some quarters, and assigned me a duty roster. Six days I was up there, Sarah. I worked double shifts, and hardly slept a wink. Wonderful place it was; ships coming and going, cars moving up and down to the outer stations. Fantastic. It was alive, bustling; like a city, or&#x2026;a market. A busy one, you know the kind, that sells everything. Fruits, vegetables, silks and furs. Spices, hot food, live animals, dead animals. The lot. And everywhere you look: people. People coming, people going, everyone in a rush. Always behind schedule, always with a job to do.

"And for six marvellous days, Sarah, I was one of them. I was up there. Elevated, they call it. But I was, Sarah. I was up there, and I was doing it. I was pushing us further out, I was helping us climb out of our gravity well. I was there."

*Female:* "And then you came back?"

*Male:* "That's right, I did. Can't stay up there forever, and the elevator was going back down. They said to me, 'Huck, you've done a great job, you're here to stay. Grab your things, say your goodbyes, and come straight back up'.

"Humph. I only came down for a change of clothes, and a couple of books. I could've stayed up there, Sarah. I'd have been up there when the Sheen came."

*Female:* "Do you regret it? Coming down?"

*Male:* "Do I regret it? No. Do I ever wonder what life would have been like if I'd stayed? Sometimes. But, I'm glad I came down. Grateful for the life I've led. Wouldn't have met my wife if I'd stayed up there, would I? Wouldn't have had the girls. My place is down here, on Earth. That's where we belong."

*Female:* "You must have been disappointed, though, when the Sheen came?"

*Male:* "Disappointed?! Goodness me, Sarah, I was devastated! Horrified! I mean, we all were, weren't we? We knew that we couldn't get them off Mars, but we were fighting to keep them off the Moon. That was the point behind the whole thing. Make, ship, lift, build, defend! That's what the adverts used to say. That's why we were all so furiously busy, all over the world&#x2013;to keep the Sheens off Earth.

"But none of it mattered, did it? They came anyway."

*Female:* "What was it like, Jim? When they came?"

*Male:* "Well, I was in the bottom station collecting my things, and waiting for the next elevation. It was about two in the afternoon, and it was an especially clear and bright day. Beautiful it was. I was on my way back from the harbour with the last bag of my bits from the ship, crunching up the compacted snow of the track.

"It popped out of nowhere about four kilometres up. Sent the clouds rippling back like a stone in a lack, it did. Smashed all the windows, sent an avalanche down over the South wing, and capsized my ship. All hands lost, Sarah. It all happened so fast; too fast.

"And then, nothing; it just hung there. Did you know? Oblivious, it was. Loomed over us for two days whilst we fished the drowned from the sea, and tried to find survivors in the snow. Grim, it was. Ranks of frozen bodies lining the dock. What a waste. And people forget, you know? The destruction started from the very beginning. It was a disaster before it so much as looked at the tether."

*Female:* "Tell us what happened on the third day, Jim."

*Male:* "Oh, you know what happened. We all know what happened."

*Female:* "What was it like for you, Jim, personally? You had so much at stake; your future, your dream. And you're the only one left to tell us now. What was it like to be there?"

> A long silence, unbroken by either voice.

*Male:* "I remember the sounds more than anything. There was a crack, like a whip, but longer. More like an explosion&#x2013;but not like dynamite. Like a volcano blowing itself to pieces, but muffled. Up in the clouds. And then, there was this rushing noise. Ghastly, it was. Makes me sweat to think of it. Howling, screaming, tearing, louder and louder, and then&#x2026;darkness.

"I was knocked down by something; woke up later. Chilled to the bone I was, and covered in dust. I had a splitting headache. Wandered around for a bit, until I found some other people. The place was in ruins, dust and snow everywhere. Everyone looked like me, or worse. A lot of people had blood and broken bones, a lot of people didn't see the night through.

"The Sheen was still there, hanging in the sky. Almost looked innocent, it did, as if nothing had even happened. Some people saw it though. A single ray of light; sliced right through the tether. The top was gone, of course, and the tension in the bottom had laid waste to the mountain.

"We were picked up a few days later by a Navy ship, those of us who were left. Took us home, and that was that. I've not been back since."

*Female:* "Thank you for telling us Jim, I know that can't have been easy."

*Male:* "That's why you asked me here, isn't it? To tell the truth?"

*Female:* "It is, but still. We appreciate your honesty, Jim, we all do. Everyone here, everyone listening. You're the last person left who can tell us the story. Your story."

> A pause.

*Female:* "Can I ask you one more question, Jim?"

*Male:* "You may Sarah, you may."

*Female:* "Did you ever go back? To the elevator, the remains I mean?"

*Male:* "I never did. Why would I? Had to put it behind me; we all did. We had to keep on going, and hope for the best. That meant staying home, staying down here, and building a life for ourselves. Not dreaming of a place we couldn't go, or a life we couldn't lead.

"What about you, Sarah? You been there?"

*Female:* "I did, just once, a few years ago. I wanted to know what it was like."

*Male:* "And?"

*Female:* "Well, it's a lot like you described Jim. The ruins, the fallen tether, the hull of your ship. The Sheen, too. Just hanging there, impassive, oblivious."

*Male:* "Best to put it behind you, if you ask me. Your future's down here now, not up there. Look to your home; to your friends; to your family. Look to love, that'll see you through. You can't cut love with a ray of light, or reduce it to rubble in the wink of an eye. Love lasts longer than dreams, and it's warmer than space. Just look at those Sheens. Cold like space, and no love&#x2013;no humanity&#x2013;to speak of. We're best off down here. Maybe that's why they're here; to keep us here. Who can say?"

*Female:* "Well, Jim, we're just about out of time. Thanks again for joining us today, and for sharing your memories."

*Male:* "You're welcome Sarah, I hope you'll return the favour, and visit me in Carmarthen one of these days."

*Female:* "Thank you Jim, that would be lovely. Jim Huck, ladies and gentleman, last surviving member of the elevated, and the last soul alive to have been to space and back, and lived to tell the take.
