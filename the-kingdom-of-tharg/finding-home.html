            <div class="col-sm"></div>
            <div class="col-lg"><p>Calir awoke frozen and hungry. He was surrounded by snow-covered rock, but he was laying in a wet patch where his body heat had turned the snow to slush. Aevum was sat next to him, huddled in his cloak like the bundle of rags that Calir had first taken him for. Sitting up, Calir looked around at the barren, icy landscape with despondency and wrapped his cloak around him even tighter.</p>
<p>"This is not Domum!" he called over the frigid wind that was blowing ice and snow around them.</p>
<p>"Indeed," came the muffled reply.</p>
<p>"I thought she was sending us home!" cried Calir with desperation in his voice.</p>
<p>"The Dark Mirror sends us where and when she pleases, friend. Be thankful we're on the surface and not in a deeper level of hell."</p>
<p>With this the mage stood up and gathered his cloak about him even closer.</p>
<p>"Come! Have courage friend - I shall accompany you on your quest. I was waiting for your presence for release from the clutches of the Mirror. I am in your debt. I shall help you reach this Domum place and then the debt will be settled. Come! What say you?"</p>
<p>He extended his arm to a miserable Calir, who had buried his head in his hands partly out of desperation and partly to try to shield his face from the icy wind. He looked up as Aevum proffered his hand and, taking a deep breath, reached out and let himself be pulled to his feet.</p>
<p>"Yes, well, it is what it is. We must make the most of what luck we have!"</p>
<p>He brushed snow of his cloak and tightened his belt, giving his surroundings one more cursory glance before turning back to Aevum once more.</p>
<p>"So my magical friend, since we are to be joined in this quest I shall give you the dubious honour of deciding on our initial path. Which way to Domum, oh mage of great power?"</p>
<p>The mage missed the sarcasm in Calir's voice, which was lucky for Calir.</p>
<p>"You do us both a great service to leave this decision up to me. A mage is never lost and I, for one, happen to know precisely where we are. Domum you say? The continent of your home is...this way!"</p>
<p>Aevum pointed to his right and slightly behind him and, without waiting to see if Calir would follow him, stalked away into the snow. Calir hesitated for a moment. After all, he was only being polite by suggesting that the mage should choose their direction of travel. But, after all, if the mage knew something about this region that was more than Calir. If he had been lost before when he had stumbled into Tharg's den, he was utterly astray now. At least, with the palace of Tharg, they had slowly wandered into that hostile and alien landscape. Now, he had found himself suddenly and incomprehensibly in the middle of an Arctic ice field unlike anything he had seen before. It was even different from Tharg's kingdom, if that was possible. Ice beyond ice with no friendly - yet deceiving - fortresses in sight. Yes, Aevum was right to take the initiative and Calir would be a fool not to follow him. With this realisation, Calir hastened to catch up with the mage who was already almost out of sight in the near-blizzard of the swirling ice and snow. He ran after him and tried to keep pace.</p>
<p>So began the long trek of Calir and Aevum across the glacial planes of the Ice Continent. Little did Calir know at the time, but there were still very much in the territory claimed by Tharg. Indeed, they had been released by the Dark Mirror not all that far from Tharg's palace itself. But, the mage said nothing of this - whether he knew it or not - and he and Calir trudged on in ignorance of their proximity to the site of Calir's capture. With the mountains to the West and the icy expanse of the Ice Continent stretching away to the North, an untrained observer would question the mage's choice of heading East. However, for better or worse, he knew of an ancient and mysterious bridge from the Ice Continent back to Domum. Objectively, Domum Continent was off to the West, South of the mountains. However, in this land twisted by magic and stitched together with sorcery, East to the sea and beyond was the only path back to the South and West. Thus, Aevum led the beguiled Calir off across the ice sheets until, after many days of frigid marching they reached the sea.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>"Honestly my good man, will this devilry never end?"</p>
<p>"I told you, friend Calir, the further we are from the influence of the Dark Mirror, the less you will feel its effects. By the time we return to your own land, your hunger will be your own again."</p>
<p>"So you keep saying, but I cannot get used to this. First we were frozen in time with no appetite or sleep, and now we're frozen again you say, but this time with hunger! I say, what a hellish position to find oneself in. Hungry with no need of food. Tired with no need of sleep. Yet this abominable cold and no way to keep warm. Couldn't she have made us immune to that?"</p>
<p>Aevum sighed. After a few days of listening to Calir's good natured yet irritating complaints, he was starting to weary of the fellow's company. Still, he had promised to help the man reach his homeland and a mage didn't rescind his word simply because his companion wouldn't stop extolling his.</p>
<p>"As I have said, friend Calir, the ways of the Dark Mirror are mysterious. It is not for us to question her wisdom or her sorcery. Be glad she did not cast these effects on us permanently. A few more days and we shall be home - your home, at least - and all of these inconveniences will be forgotten."</p>
<p>Calir shrugged and huffed, clearly not happy with Aevum's response but aware of a small degree of frustration seeping through the mage's voice. Calir had decided that any magical person with the word ‘Dark' in their title was best left un-enraged, whether they be friend or foe. Aevum seemed to be a friend, but still.</p>
<p>"Now, back to the task at hand. As I was saying, we will need to cross the Gelida sea to make it back to your homeland. It is frozen this close to the Ice Continent, but it thaws the further out we get."</p>
<p>"An ocean? How are we going to cross a frozen ocean?"</p>
<p>Calir was beginning to get desperate. How did he find himself needing to cross a frozen ocean in a frozen wasteland when a few days ago he was a day's walk from home?</p>
<p>"Its not an ocean, friend Calir, just a sea and barely fifteen miles wide at its narrowest, where we will cross. And there is a way to cross, albeit an ancient and dark way, but one that I am familiar with. Indeed, it is lucky for you that I am a Mage of Darkness, otherwise you would surely be captured and killed in the crossing. As it is, we are very likely to survive the attempt."</p>
<p>Calir let out a high pitched choke in response to this and looked even more forlorn. All he wanted was to be back home, in a friendly ale-house with good food and good friends. Yet here he was, crossing an enchanted sea of dark magic by a secret way that that was only safe for sorcerers of the night!</p>
<p>"Strength, friend Calir, strength. Inside of two days, we will be back in the sunlight of your homeland."</p>
<p>Stood in the icy wind, under a darkening sky and surrounded by the moonscape of shattered ice and jutting glacier, Calir could barely believe this. But, he had to put his trust in something and Aevum had proven himself a worthy companion thus far. Two days more and he would know for sure if he was being led home or into another frozen prison. He cleared his throat.</p>
<p>"Very well my good man," he replied, sounding somewhat more like his former self. "If two more days are required of me to reach my home, I shall take it. I thank you for your guidance and protection, but beyond the stretch of those days I feel that I shall surely perish from cold, desperation and despair. Let us be gone from this place and find this dark crossing of yours."</p>
<p>Aevum smiled in response to this (although Calir wouldn't have called it that) and inclined his head, turning on his heel and leading the way, continuing across the fractured landscape.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>"The Gelida sea!"</p>
<p>Aevum pointed far out to the horizon, across the smooth, white sheet of ice that was the only sign that they'd reached the coast. The sky was still a dark, steely grey above them. But, out towards the horizon it seemed to lighten slightly and you could almost imagine the sun shining somewhere out there, warming the ice to become gently lapping waves. The most curious feature of the frozen sea was the crossing that Aevum had led them to. Not far from the shore was an enormous, wooden galleon ship. It was glued into the ice at an unnatural angle, with chains and ropes trailing from it into the frozen water. It was if it had been sailing out of the bay and had been caught in a sudden permafrost, frozen into the unchanging landscape of the sea to become a permanent moment of pitching and yawing. It had an eery look to it, for whilst the ropes and lines were preserved in positions of life, the sails were torn and ragged, flapping sadly in the cold breeze. The only moving parts of the ships were these remnants of a past that had, in all other ways, been preserved on the ship.</p>
<p>"And that," he moved his arm in the direction of the galleon, "is the beginning of the bridge across the ice."</p>
<p>"The ship?"</p>
<p>"The ship. If you look further out, there is another, and another. They stretch all the way out to the ice barrier between the Ice Continent and the place you call home."</p>
<p>"But why do we need them? Surely we can just walk across the ice?"</p>
<p>"We will need them before the end. The further we get from these shores, the more we will require food, sleep and shelter. The Gelida sea is utterly barren - even more so than the continent we have just crossed. And, eventually, when we reach the edge of the sea - when it thaws into the milder waters you're used to - we'll need a vessel in which to cross the final stretch. This place is the only place where we can cross the sea with all of these things that we need. It was created in ages past, whether by design or some strange sea-battle no-one knows. But, it is here now and we will use it."</p>
<p>"Yes, of course my good man, I wasn't questioning your guidance for a single moment! Didn't you say something earlier about danger? Not for us, of course, but for those vulnerable travellers not aided by a mage of your power and experience?"</p>
<p>Aevum paused.</p>
<p>"There is danger. No-one knows the origin of this crossing, but the ships are preserved in some kind of frozen time. Parts of the ships age and rot-"</p>
<p>"Like the sails?"</p>
<p>"Yes, like the sails. But other parts are frozen in a moment of time. Perhaps when the ice came in, perhaps when the Dark Mirror came. No-one knows for sure."</p>
<p>"But the danger?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, but the danger comes from the crews. The crews are all captured in this moment in time in the same way as the ships. Parts of them are preserved in a frozen moment, locked into the ships as the vessels themselves are locked into the ice. Other parts are ragged and rotten like the sails that hang from the rank masts. We will need the ships before the end, but we must be wary of the crews. Most are afraid of dark mages such as myself, but not all are dissuaded by the power I can bring to bear. We will need to be on our guard."</p>
<p>Calir shivered at this thought and looked out to sea, past the galleon and out to the ships beyond. He couldn't see Domum Continent beyond the darkness of the sky and ice, but he had to believe that it was out there. He had to believe that Aevum was leading him to salvation and not into a trap of his doom.</p>
<p>"Very well, my good man. Let us begin. All this waiting is making me feel jumpy!"</p>
<p>He tightened the belt around his waist, wrapped his cloak around himself more tightly and bravely began to lead the way down the coast towards the smooth, glassy, frozen sea. Emboldened by his fear, he struck a braver figure than he could have thought and Aevum felt, for a moment, a touch of affection for the simple-minded and fair-spirited man. Only for a moment, though. After this, he replaced it with his customary dark brooding and followed swiftly after Calir to take the lead once again.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Silence prevailed as they padded across the frozen water. Occasionally a vibrating tremor would run through surface, from the depths of the ice. Some shifting or changing that would propagate out to their feet like a leviathan of the deep reaching out for an instant. Silence prevailed between them as well. They walked on in silence. They had passed twenty or thirty great galleon ships now, Calir had lost count, yet still the ice stretched on ahead of them. Calir was certain he could see a lightening on the horizon now. It was if the dark ceiling of cloud above them stretched out to a particular point and then dispersed, revealing sunshine and warmth beyond. That's the way he imagined it anyway, with the ice ending at the same point, giving way to a gentle sea, lapping against the ice gaily with a pleasant warmth that welcomed the weary traveller. Calir was hungry, as usual, but now he was beginning to feel tired as well. Unlike previous days, he felt that he needed food to give him strength to carry on marching, not just to satisfy his unwavering hunger. Not only that, but he was thirsty too, and felt a renewed need for rest. He was terrified by the idea of climbing up into one of these ships for shelter and rest, but at the same time he didn't think he could make it all the way out to the horizon without respite. After several hours of brooding on these thoughts, he decided to broach the topic to Aevum.</p>
<p>"Well, my good fellow. I don't know about you, but I'm just about ready for some supper and shut-eye. What say you, eh?"</p>
<p>He tried to make this remark sound as jovial as possible, but the energy in his voice was muffled by the silent ice and ominous hull looming ahead of them. The ship they were drawing close to was stuck in the ice at an angle close to thirty degrees as if it had been swaying in the swell of the sea at the moment it was captured by the mirror-flat surface of the ice. Lines of rigging dangled over the sides in loose strands here and there that were frozen in a swish of wind that was forever immortalised by the freeze. Contrary to the timeless moment the ship was caught in, there was a tattered black and red flag hanging from the jaunty mast, flapping limply in the still air. To all appearances, it looked like a long-dead wreck imprisoned by the ice and mercilessly held captive across the centuries.</p>
<p>"That looks like a homely spot if ever I saw one!"</p>
<p>Calir gestured towards the wreck optimistically, looking at Aevum for affirmation.</p>
<p>"Indeed, it is drawing close to that time. We're close the edge of the ice shelf now, nearly at the boundary of the Dark Mirror's influence, but we will need to rest before we reach it. This one will do as well as any other."</p>
<p>They shuffled over to the ship across the ice, slipping here and there as it started to take on a wet sheen that foreshadowed the impending end of the ice sheet. The near-side of the ship was it's port side and it was pitched over such that they could see the far side of the deck above them. Close to, the balustrade around the edge of the deck was only a metre or so above their heads and was an easy climb up the trailing ropes hanging over the edge of the ship here and there. Despite the braids of the ropes being frozen, they managed to clamber aboard and were soon looking up at the width of the deck sloping up in front of them. On either side of them, the forecastle and poop were at a jaunty angle that served as a constant reminder that the ship appeared to have been frozen part way through being swept to one side by the swells of the water. They walked awkwardly towards the poop, where they both agreed a door would probably lead to the captain's cabin. Scattered along their path were the flotsam and jetsam of a working ship - crates and frozen spools of rope, barrels and rags of sails. They had clearly been flung about violently in some prior storm or battle, but now were all laid to rest against the balustrade that teetered out over the frozen sea.</p>
<p>"I hope there's a good meal to be had in their somewhere," Calir said under his breath, indicating the captain's cabin. "I heard that there was always a good stash of salted fish, or rum-soaked biscuits or other such sea-faring food, hidden away in the captain's trunk for when times ran hard on board ship. Hopefully the cold weather will have helped preserve it and there'll be enough for a snack. A snack and a snooze, that's all I need and then I'll be ready for one final push."</p>
<p>Calir paused, waiting for Aevum to agree - or disagree - but the mage was impassively silent.</p>
<p>"What say you, eh? My good man?", he prompted, still in a whisper.</p>
<p>"It is best not to hope or to speculate on the frozen wrecks of yonder year. There might be more than food and less than life hiding in that cabin and we should prepare for anything we might find."</p>
<p>"A little hard to do, don't you think?"</p>
<p>Aevum raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Prepare for anything we might find? Might as well suggest that we measure a never-ending rope or boil a forever frozen pot-"</p>
<p>"Hush, friend Calir! Let us proceed with caution. There may be danger ahead, even to a mage such as myself. Hush."</p>
<p>Despite feeling more than a little put out by Aevum's abrupt tone, Calir acquiesced and clasped his belt with cold fingers as they approached the door. The door itself was closed, but at this angle, it would only take a small push for it to swing open with a bang. This made Calir think it was either locked or frozen shut and would certainly be hard for the casual passer-by to open. Aevum approached the door first and pushed gently with his fist around the handle. The door gave easily, almost as if it had been waiting to be opened by a warm-blooded hand all these centuries. It yielded without a squeak or a squeal. Despite clearly having been frozen amidst the violence of the sea centuries ago, this door was as ready to be opened as the day it had been fashioned.</p>
<p>They stepped in and adjusted to the lack of grey light that filtered in through the rear, grilled window. Inside the low room was a short, rectangular table around which were arranged six chairs. The chairs were turned this way and that as if their occupants had been halfway through the ceremony of standing or sitting at the time of their disappearance. The table itself was covered in plates and bowls, all of which were covered in a thick layer of dust. As Calir acclimatised to the light, he noticed that the chairs were also covered in large quantities of thick, grey dust, as was the floor around the chairs and tables. At first glance, the rest of the room was unremarkable. There was a writing table in front of the window, which was empty and a large trunk in the corner of the room. The fact that it was still in-place suggested that it was fixed to the floor in some capacity.</p>
<p>"Humph," Calir remarked involuntarily.</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Well, it's odd isn't it?"</p>
<p>"These ships are magically frozen in time and space, in the midst of an enchanted sea that is trapped in a permafrost for all eternity. The whole thing is odd, friend Calir."</p>
<p>"Yes, well apart from all that, the trunk there, it's stuck to the floor. You see?"</p>
<p>"Yes..."</p>
<p>"Well, I thought, ‘Oh it must be nailed down' - you know, to stop it from sliding across the floor down to this side of the room. But then, the chairs and the table. The dishes and the plates. The dust and grime that's covering everything. Its like none of it is affected by the angle of the deck. And, I say, that's odd isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Well, now you mention it, yes, that is odd. Very odd."</p>
<p>"Out on the deck, all those crates and so on had slid down the left-hand side of the ship, where we've been walking."</p>
<p>"The port side."</p>
<p>"Yes, well, they've all slid down as one would expect them to. Its hard enough to walk along the deck when it's pitched this far over."</p>
<p>"Indeed."</p>
<p>"But all the furniture in here, it's sort of - well, stuck I suppose. As if it hasn't noticed that the ship's halfway to capsizing."</p>
<p>The two men looked around thoughtfully, not daring to venture any further into the room. A minute or more might have elapsed, before they both exclaimed in unison.</p>
<p>"I say!"</p>
<p>"What the devil!"</p>
<p>"You see it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's getting thicker...something's...forming..."</p>
<p>As they watched, the dust around the chairs and table seemed to be wafting across the floor and sliding up the chair legs. It was gathering on the seats of the chairs and clumping into piles here and there. The same thing was happening on the table top, as the grey powder swirled in drifts from place to place, concentrating into thicker patches on the plates and bowls. The dust on the chairs was now a solid mass growing upwards into a conical pile. Moments later it was changing colour from grey to greens, browns and reds.</p>
<p>"Phwoah, do you smell that?"</p>
<p>The mixture on the chairs was turning slimy and slick now, oozing over the edge of the seat and dripping down the legs. The smell was offensive. The reds looked awfully like decaying blood and the greens had the odour of rotting flesh.</p>
<p>"What's happening?" Calir exclaimed in a choked voice. Aevum watched impassively, a frown crossing his face.</p>
<p>As they watched in horror, the flesh and liquids began re-assembling themselves into bone and muscle, skin and hair. A rotting form of a corpse took shape before their eyes, the ageing process reversed. Time running backwards. Before long, the corpses had turned to peaceful figures sitting calmly at the moments of their death. The food on the table had passed through rotting and mouldy phases to appear again fresh and appealing. For a moment, the scene was peaceful and calm and, bizarrely, the most normal sight Calir had witnessed in what felt like years. Three men sat around a dinner table enjoying an array of foods and drinks. This moment perched on the edge of a temporal fulcrum before plunging back into the destructive rampage of age and decay. The eyeballs turned black and sunk into the skulls, the food was engulfed by grey-green fur and collapsed in on itself, the skin sank between the ribs exposing bloody bone and shredding meat. The figures crumpled into a ruin of maimed flesh and weeping fluid. The foods were just pools of mottled liquid. The wetness dried, the colours dimmed and seeming moments after it had all begun again, the table and chairs were once again covered in thick piles of grey dust. Time had erased the lives of men and meal alike, leaving nothing but ash.</p>
<p>A pause spread out between the two men and them now empty room. They stared at the dim, grey room aghast. Calir's guts rumbled.</p>
<p>"Do you think it's safe to eat?"</p>
<p>Aevum turned to face Calir, a look of horror on his face.</p>
<p>"Safe? Sorcery this dark is a rare and malevolent thing. Before your hand had reached the table, you would be doomed to the same fate as these poor souls. Eternally suffering death and decay, only to be reincarnated at the apex of your peace. No, friend Calir this is the least safe place we have seen together and we should leave at once. Your next meal will have to wait a while longer, we must reach the edge of the ice or we shall be trapped in the dead time of this place. The Dark Mirror does not let her charges go idly and it seems that she seeks to entrap us again in her iniquitous ways. Let us be gone from this place!"</p>
<p>With this, the mage turned on his heel and left the cabin, carefully but swiftly making his way back along the pitched deck to the nearest of the trailing ropes. A moment later, when the shock of these words had worn off, Calir followed as fast as he could, stumbling on the awkward angle of the ship. He was suddenly afraid of the horrific visage perpetually repeating itself around the captain's table and was desperate - more than ever - to reach the safe and pleasant shores of Domum. Slipping and sliding down the frozen ropes, they made it back to the ice. Landing with a dull thud on the mirrored sheen of the frozen sea, they disturbed the silence that ruled the glacial waves. From out here, there was no sign of the hidden malice contained within the belly of the ship. Just an old wreck of a galleon, held fast by a timeless sea and a still air.</p>
<p>"Let us be gone," Aevum repeated in a low voice.</p>
<p>The pair struggled on and on. Calir's hunger had increased to fervent levels now and his legs were weak and trembling. He was stumbling with fatigue and beginning to suffer from the cold in his bones, not just in his hands or his feet. Aevum wasn't in a much better condition, although he was better at hiding it. He knew that their situation was becoming desperate and that they needed to reach the edge of the ice soon. He had started to entertain the idea that the Dark Mirror might have been tricking them into a path that led back towards the Ice Continent, rather than away from it and that they might end up making landfall back at the ice where they had begun. If this was happening, all was lost. They had lost the strength to go on and she would have ensnared them forever in bonds that they could not break. The mage was simply holding out hope that his instincts were worth following and that their course was true. If it was, then any minute now they should be able to see the end of the ice. The sky was lightening beyond doubt and he was sure he could feel more frequent stirrings in the air. Even if these could not be described as warm, they certainly weren't the Arctic blasts they had experienced inland, and that was a good sign. He shared none of his concerns with Calir, of course. The poor fellow was suffering terribly and a word of bad news was likely to finish him off. So, he pulled together his spirits and tried to encourage the forlorn Calir with us much vigour as he could muster.</p>
<p>"Almost there now, friend Calir. I can smell dry land from across the seas. We are surely at the end of our journey. Moments more, you'll see, and we shall reach the final ship and the edge of the ice."</p>
<p>Before he'd finished uttering these words, Calir had stopped in his tracks and raised his face with a fresh look of hope. Aevum hadn't imagined that he could be so inspiring, but perhaps the poor fool was easier to convince than he suspected.</p>
<p>"Do you hear that?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes," replied the mage, "those are the words I just spoke to you."</p>
<p>The poor man was even wearier than he had thought.</p>
<p>"No, not that," Calir waved his hand dismissively, "that!"</p>
<p>With this, he pointed straight ahead and cocked his head. Aevum listened. Right on the edge of his sense of sound was a gentle lapping sound. Come to think of it, there was a faint odour of salt in the air as well.</p>
<p>"Its the sea!"</p>
<p>His fatigue forgotten, Calir sprang forward as if he'd just had a good night's sleep and a hearty meal. He ran across the ice with a dull thump that became more of a wet slap as he began to stumble through puddles and pools. Within fifty metres he came across a beach of ice, with gentle waves washing against it in a warm caress. Ahead of him was a calm sea and a mild breeze; clear skies and a bright sun. It was as if they had suddenly walked out from underneath a freezing cloud into a warm, tropical landscape of humid airs and mild waters. And then Calir saw it. Out beyond the tranquil waves was a shoreline stretching right across the horizon. A band of browns and greens with a haze of warm cloud hovering over it. No blues or whites, no ice of glacier. Just home beyond home beyond home. Domum Continent was there, not more than five or ten miles from the edge of the ice shelf upon which they finally stood.</p>
<p>Aevum caught up with him and stood beside him, gazing out to sea.</p>
<p>"Ah. So we have made it after all. I am thankful, we will be safe now."</p>
<p>Calir was looking crestfallen.</p>
<p>"But friend Calir, whatever is the matter? We have succeeded in our journey, have we not? You are in sight of your home land, you should be celebrating!"</p>
<p>"There might as well be another gulf of ice and snow between it and us though, mightn't there? How on earth are we going to cross the open ocean - you've led us to a dead end!"</p>
<p>Aevum smiled.</p>
<p>"Far from it, friend. It is not an open ocean, but merely a straight of six or seven miles. And we will cross it in that, of course!"</p>
<p>He pointed out to their right in a direction Calir hadn't looked in yet, having been so fixated with the view ahead of them. A great galleon ship, bigger than any they had yet seen, was trapped in the edge of the ice and facing out to sea. The stern was frozen fast and perfectly preserved, much as the other ships they had seen had been. The ship leaned forward and the bow, however, was partially submerged in the gently sloshing water which flowed in and out of innumerable holes making the ship look more like a wreck at the front. Halfway along its length, where the ice ended and the ship entered the water there was almost a clean line where these two halves of the boat joined. To the rear, a frozen, preserved vessel with only ragged sails to show its age. To the front, a rotten and smashed wreck nearing collapse. Aevum saw Calir looking puzzled at this.</p>
<p>"We have reached the limit of the Dark Mirror's influence. Beyond the ice shelf, her reign over space and time is diminished and all things return to their natural way."</p>
<p>Calir turned his confused features to the mage.</p>
<p>"But how does this help us? Its a wreck that's half encased in ice and half ready to sink! Seven miles at sea in a wreck is still seven miles!"</p>
<p>"Yes, but this was the flag ship, friend Calir. The ancient armada of ships captured by the Dark Mirror all those ages ago was led by this vessel, which was caught at the last and who's escape was forever thwarted. This is the biggest, grandest and most well equipped ship of the fleet. Do you not think we might find something seaworthy onboard?"</p>
<p>"Ah! You mean like a landing craft or a lifeboat or something?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, yes. And, with luck, the dangers we encountered on the other ships will be less readily felt here. Let us investigate further and find a way to your home."</p>
<p>Aevum made his way over the flagship and Calir skipped after him with a renewed sense of energy that thirty minutes earlier he would have thought impossible. Sure enough on the port side, obscured from their previous vantage point, a small craft was suspended from frozen lines halfway lowered to the frozen sea below it. It was perfectly preserved like the stern of its mother-ship and was even complete with oars. After some struggling with the frozen ropes holding it fast (which was made considerably more difficult due to their reluctance to board the galleon itself), the pair managed to free the dinghy and drag it to the water's edge. Aevum held it steady in the peaceful waters, whilst Calir climbed aboard. The mage climbed in after him and they cast off. Within moments they were clear of the ice and, after about fifty metres or so, the entire frozen coastline began to disappear into a hazy sheen. By the time they'd covered two hundred metres, the flagship, the ice and the cursed continent beyond were all shrouded in a simple, white haze of cloud. The uninformed mariner would have no idea they were sailing so close to being caught in the snare of the Dark Mirror and neither would they know the risk of coming aground against the ice itself. It looked like a pleasant bank of cloud hovering over the sea, masking nothing more than the expanse of gentle, warm waves and still, pleasant air.</p>
<p>"Let that be the last we see of that accursed place," Calir murmured as they departed. "I just wish my friends had a more pleasant fate than being locked away in the wintry fortress of King Tharg."</p>
<p>"Tharg?"</p>
<p>Aevum had been lost in a reverie of his own.</p>
<p>"Mmm, yes. Your friends will be caught won't they. Well, let's not think of that now. Let's get you back to your home and rest our weary bones."</p>
<p>"Amen to that, my good man, amen to that."</p>
<p>And so the two prisoners, travellers and companions rowed away from the ice continent. The frigid wasteland home to the Kingdom of Tharg, the Dark Mirror and their hidden, timeless prison cell was now behind them. Against all odds they had escaped and made their way back to the land of time and life, back to Calir's home: Domum Continent. But, even in the relief of their freedom, Calir could not help casting his mind back to the friends he had left behind. He couldn't help feeling he had abandoned them to a life of despair and misery at the hands of Tharg and his cronies. And, deeper down, he couldn't help feeling that something was wrong about their escape; something was wrong about this homecoming. The path in the mountains that he had somehow strayed from all those days ago seemed far removed from their present situation. Only time would tell now. However, with each oar stroke they were closer to home and, smothering all of his feelings of disquiet, he couldn't help feeling an overwhelming sense of deliverance from the horrors of the Dark Mirror.</p>
<p>Aevum stared ahead implacably. He pulled on his oar, but said nothing more.</p>
